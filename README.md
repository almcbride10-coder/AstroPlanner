Comprehensive Equipment Configuration:
Set telescope aperture and focal length.
Manage a custom list of available eyepieces, Barlow lenses, and filters.
Real-Time Conditions: Users can input current seeing, weather, and light pollution (Bortle scale) to get a realistic list of visible objects.
Advanced Date & Time Filtering:
Select a specific date to view all visible objects for that night.
View upcoming events for the "Week Ahead" or "Month Ahead."
Displays rise/set times for planetary and lunar objects.
Night Vision Protection:

Dynamic Moon Phase & Icon: Accurately calculates and displays the moon's phase, illumination percentage, and age for any selected date with a visually correct icon.
External Tool Integration: Provides quick links to external resources like Meteoblue (for seeing), Clear Outside (for weather), and Light Pollution Maps to help users accurately assess their conditions.
